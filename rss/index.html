It automates the process of monitoring and controlling the interactions of groups of xbox live users, adding and removing friends and wiping user data.</p><p>We&apos;ve identified four key pain points and tailored our features to provide solutions:</p><ol><li><strong>Adding Users And Consoles To Your Fleet:</strong> Adding a new Xbox to your fleet and friending that Xbox console/user to every other console/user in your fleet requires that you 1) add every other to the new console/user and 2) Add your new user to every existing console/user in your fleet. This is prohibitively difficult. With CoPlay XM, we&apos;ve greatly simplified this process, ensuring that adding new users and establishing connections across consoles is quick and effortless. What used to take dozens of hours, now only takes a couple minutes.</li><li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> Allowing your users to add friends and family and play online is beneficial for connection and enjoyment. However, It is common that users will leave identifying information in the messages they send and the friends they add.</li><li><strong>Account Cleanup:</strong> Wiping users data from Xbox consoles is a challenge for hospitals and other organizations. It currently requires that someone log into the Xbox App or console or each individual account and clear the data.</li><li><strong>Activity Monitoring:</strong> It&apos;s important for organizations like hospitals to know how and what there devices are being used for. This is beneficial for safety and resource planning.</li></ol><p><strong>Current Features And Services:</strong> CoPlay XM currently offers a range of features designed to cater to the unique needs of hospitals and organizations managing Xbox console fleets:</p><ul><li><strong>Monitor User Activity:</strong> Gain valuable insights into user behavior, gameplay patterns, and console usage, empowering you to make informed decisions based on real data.</li><li><strong>Control Friending List:</strong> Create a safe and secure gaming environment by easily managing and curating friends lists across multiple consoles.</li><li><strong>Monitor and Clear Conversation Data:</strong> CoPlay XM allows you to monitor and delete conversation data, ensuring that sensitive information stays confidential and protected.</li><li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> Stay on top of console usage, identify trends, and optimize resources effectively for a seamless gaming experience.</li><li><strong>Gamepass and Xbox Live Subscription Management:</strong> Simplify subscription management by handling Gamepass and Xbox Live subscriptions in one centralized location, guaranteeing uninterrupted access to gaming services.</li><li><strong>Account Creation:</strong> Streamline the onboarding process by effortlessly creating new user accounts and establishing connections across multiple Xbox consoles.</li></ul><p><em>Subscription management and Account Creation are offered as services along side CoPlay XM.</em></p><p><strong>Coming Soon:</strong> We&apos;re constantly working to improve CoPlay XM and provide you with an even better experience.

Luckily, we&apos;ve developed what we call &quot;Loadouts&quot; to help simplify this process. </p><p>Today we will talk about the &quot;Pro Loadout&quot;. This is the recommended configuration for your xbox that allows your users to add and message friends and play online in a way that allows your to monitor and manage activity through CoPlay XM.</p><p><em>Please note that this configuration is <strong>only</strong> recommended to be used in combination with CoPlay XM as it allows your users more freedom in playing with friends and family members but also allows your to clean up and wipe the user activity via CoPlay XM when they are finished. </em></p><h2 id="the-coplay-pro-loadout">The CoPlay Pro Loadout</h2><p>This loadout is designed to let patients play games with each other online while not allowing text or voice communication with anyone outside the hospital. Patients can message and voice chat with each other while Coplay XM clears any message history nightly so all PHI can be cleared from the device. One more feature this loadout gives patients is the ability to play games and have text/voice communication with friends and family online. Meanwhile, stopping any &#x201C;strangers&#x201D; from interacting with them. You can decide the ratings of content you want to allow patients to access all while stopping patients from:</p><ul><li>Adding their own Xbox accounts</li><li>Removing the hospitals from the Xbox</li><li>Changing settings</li><li>Purchasing games</li><li>Web surfing</li><li>Linking social media accounts</li><li>Resetting the console</li></ul><p>This loadout will also stop games and apps from accessing any microphones or cameras that patients plug into it. We are working on ways to stop patients from downloading apps or allowing patients to login to their own app accounts (such as Netflix, Spotify, Disney +, etc) while we remove the accounts nightly. Until then, this is something your cyber security or networking department can most likely restrict on the internet firewall. </p><p>Note this loadout isn&apos;t perfect for every hospital&#x2019;s wants and needs, but we are happy to build you a custom loadout so you no longer have to question what patients have access to on your gaming systems. If used right, gaming is an amazing way for patients to pass time during their stay and can provide engaging content for the whole family to play worry free.</p><h3 id="console-settings">Console Settings</h3><h4 id="sign-in-security-pin">Sign-in, Security &amp;

The hospital wanted to put an Xbox in every patients&apos; room but quickly ran into problems setting up and managing all of their consoles. Recognizing that gaming technologies lacked the tools needed to be managed at scale, CoPlay was founded to fill in the gaps.</p><h3 id="why-we-do-what-we-do">Why we do what we do</h3><p>Hospitals lack the necessary tools and infrastructure to implement gaming technologies at scale while adhering to regulations. Existing technologies are not designed with enterprise settings in mind and often fall short in meeting the unique requirements of hospitals.</p><h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h3><p>CoPlay is driven by the belief in the transformative power of play. We aim to make gaming accessible to patients and hospitals, as it alleviates suffering, combats loneliness, fosters connection, and brings joy. Our tools facilitate safe, enjoyable, and beneficial gaming experiences for children in hospitals.</p><h3 id="technology-for-good">Technology For Good</h3><p>At CoPlay, we leverage technology for positive impact. By providing hospitals with suitable software, we enhance the accessibility and enrichment of gaming for patients.</p><h3 id="lets-do-this-together">Let&apos;s Do This Together!</h3><p>Join us as we create a world where hospitals become havens of play, comfort, and healing. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and be part of the CoPlay movement revolutionizing gaming integration for children in hospitals.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

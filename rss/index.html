It automates the process of monitoring and controlling the interactions of groups of xbox live users, adding/removing friends, and wiping user data.</p><p>We&apos;ve identified four key pain points companies face when managing a fleet of gaming systems:</p><ol><li><strong>Removing Player Data Off Your Accounts and Consoles: </strong>There are many ways data can be left on your Xbox consoles such as sending messages, logging into apps, and adding friends to the &quot;friends list&quot;. While you can prevent this by locking down the consoles with settings, this typically lowers the experience of the player. With Coplay XM you can remove app data (such as streaming loggins), reset friends lists, and delete messages from all your consoles at once, or you can set schedules that will do it for you.</li><li><strong>Keeping Things Consistent for Each Player:</strong> Downloading and removing games and apps from multiple consoles between players takes a tremendous amount of time. This makes it difficult to update game and app lists on multiple consoles. On CoplayXM, you can control what games and apps and on what Xboxes by creating Profiles for each type of Xbox configuration you need.&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Customizing Experiences to the Player:</strong> Though consistency is important, it&apos;s also important to have tools to change a players experience on your gaming systems. This could be to provide different games, apps, access to communication or other features you choose to generally restrict. Every gaming program is different but having the ability to change things on the gaming systems on a moments notice aids in managing any program needs&#xA0;</li><li><strong>Accessing account information:</strong> Gathering info about your accounts (such as settings, games being played, friends lists, games and apps downloaded on the gaming system) is no easy task. You would need to log into each account on a computer or on an Xbox, depending on the info, to see if anything is wrong with the setup. CoplayXM allows you to see all this information for all your accounts in one location at any time. This gives your program the peace of mind of always knowing the state of every account and Xbox.</li></ol><p><strong>Overview of Features And Services:</strong> CoPlay XM currently offers a range of features designed to cater to the unique needs of hospitals and organizations managing Xbox console fleets:</p><ul><li><strong>Monitor User Activity:</strong> Gain valuable insights into user behavior, gameplay patterns, and console usage, empowering you to make informed decisions based on real data.</li><li><strong>Control Friending List:</strong> Create a safe and secure gaming environment by easily managing and curating friends lists across multiple consoles.</li><li><strong>Monitor and Clear Conversation Data:</strong> CoPlay XM allows you to monitor and delete conversation data, ensuring that sensitive information stays confidential and protected.</li><li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> Stay on top of console usage, identify trends, and optimize resources effectively for a seamless gaming experience.</li><li><strong>Install and Uninstall Games and Apps:</strong> Say goodbye to manual effort. With CoPlay XM, you&apos;ll be able to easily install and uninstall games and applications across multiple consoles, saving you valuable time.</li><li><strong>Change Settings:</strong> Customize console settings remotely, ensuring consistent configurations and enhancing the gaming experience for everyone.</li><li><strong>Schedule Actions:</strong> Automate tasks and optimize console management by scheduling actions, allowing you to focus on what matters most.</li><li><strong>EMR Integration: </strong>For hospitals, it can be difficult to keep track of patients discharging and resetting the consoles before the next patient enters the room. With EMR integration Coplay XM can get a &#x201C;discharge ping&#x201D; from your EMR so when a patient discharges, Coplay XM makes any changes for you automatically to reset the system for&#xA0; the next patient.</li></ul><p><em>Subscription management and Account Creation are offered as services alongside CoPlay XM.</em></p><p><strong>Coming Soon:</strong> We&apos;re constantly working to improve CoPlay XM and provide you with an even better experience.

The hospital wanted to put an Xbox in every patients&apos; room but quickly ran into problems setting up and managing all of their consoles. Recognizing that gaming technologies lacked the tools needed to be managed at scale, CoPlay was founded to fill in the gaps.</p><h3 id="why-we-do-what-we-do">Why we do what we do</h3><p>Hospitals lack the necessary tools and infrastructure to implement gaming technologies at scale while adhering to regulations. Existing technologies are not designed with enterprise settings in mind and often fall short in meeting the unique requirements of hospitals.</p><h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h3><p>CoPlay is driven by the belief in the transformative power of play. We aim to make gaming accessible to patients and hospitals, as it alleviates suffering, combats loneliness, fosters connection, and brings joy. Our tools facilitate safe, enjoyable, and beneficial gaming experiences for children in hospitals.</p><h3 id="technology-for-good">Technology For Good</h3><p>At CoPlay, we leverage technology for positive impact. By providing hospitals with suitable software, we enhance the accessibility and enrichment of gaming for patients.</p><h3 id="lets-do-this-together">Let&apos;s Do This Together!</h3><p>Join us as we create a world where hospitals become havens of play, comfort, and healing. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and be part of the CoPlay movement revolutionizing gaming integration for children in hospitals.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

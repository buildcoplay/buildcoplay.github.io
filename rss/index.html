The hospital wanted to put an Xbox in every patients&apos; room but quickly ran into problems setting up and managing all of their consoles. Recognizing that gaming technologies lacked the tools needed to be managed at scale, CoPlay was founded to fill in the gaps.</p><h3 id="why-we-do-what-we-do">Why we do what we do</h3><p>Hospitals lack the necessary tools and infrastructure to implement gaming technologies at scale while adhering to regulations. Existing technologies are not designed with enterprise settings in mind and often fall short in meeting the unique requirements of hospitals.</p><h3 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h3><p>CoPlay is driven by the belief in the transformative power of play. We aim to make gaming accessible to patients and hospitals, as it alleviates suffering, combats loneliness, fosters connection, and brings joy. Our tools facilitate safe, enjoyable, and beneficial gaming experiences for children in hospitals.</p><h3 id="technology-for-good">Technology For Good</h3><p>At CoPlay, we leverage technology for positive impact. By providing hospitals with suitable software, we enhance the accessibility and enrichment of gaming for patients.</p><h3 id="lets-do-this-together">Let&apos;s Do This Together!</h3><p>Join us as we create a world where hospitals become havens of play, comfort, and healing. Stay tuned for updates on our progress and be part of the CoPlay movement revolutionizing gaming integration for children in hospitals.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
